- 🏫 I am a Physics undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University. I have been advised by Prof. Tina Kahniashvili and Prof. Roy Briere. 
- 🔭 I am currently interested in theoretical cosmology, specifically alternative theories of gravity in the purview of gravitational waves. I use computational and numerical methods to look at the consequences of these theores in real world data.
- 🌱 I love working on open source projects in my spare time. I use my skills to make it easier to set up systems in arch linux. I also like discovering new aspects about data by generating interesting statistics in the field of cubing, music, linguistics, anime, and more.
- 💬 Ask me about massive gravity, NANOGrav, gravitational waves, wormholes
