- 🏫 I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Prof. Tina Kahniashvili in the field of theoretical cosmology
- 🔭 I am currently interested in theoretical cosmology, specifically alternative theories of gravity in the purview of gravitational waves. I use computational and numerical methods to look at the consequences of these theories in real-world data.
- 🌱 I love working on open source projects in my spare time. I use my skills to make it easier to set up systems in arch linux. I also like discovering new aspects about data by generating interesting statistics in the field of cubing, music, linguistics, anime, and more.
- 📚 I love reading hard sci-fi (Greg Egan, Liu Cixin, Neal Stephenson, Issac Asimov, Olaf Stapledon) and speculative fiction (Ted Chiang, CM Kosemen) (my [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86513877-chris-choi)), cycling (my [Strava account](https://www.strava.com/athletes/39021617)), and consuming anime (my [MAL account](https://myanimelist.net/profile/ChrisChoi314))
- I love listening to music, especially the genre of prog rock and prog metal. I really enjoy retro prog rock from Sweden (Moon Safari, A.C.T., Kaipa, Karmakanic, Brighteye Brison), and I transcribe scores in my free time (my [Musescore account](https://musescore.com/user/47656457))
- I am a competitive speedcuber (my WCA profile is [2016CHOI01](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016CHOI01)); an all-rounder but I particularly enjoy doing [FTO (Face-Turning Octahedron)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YToga0YcG2EagDfU7jvkVqoJpNOtuuC2dwnEFIvHQNw/edit?usp=sharing)
- 💬 Ask me about massive gravity, PTAs, gravitational waves, general relativity, and FTO
