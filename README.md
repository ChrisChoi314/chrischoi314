### Hi there 👋

- 🏫 I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Prof. Tina Kahniashvili in the field of theoretical cosmology
- 🔭 I current research modified gravity, namely an extension of GR that endows gravitons with a nonzero mass known as massive gravity. I use numerical methods to look at their consequences in pulsar timing array data.
- 📚 I love reading hard sci-fi and speculative fiction (my [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86513877-chris-choi)), and consuming anime (my [MAL account](https://myanimelist.net/profile/ChrisChoi314))
- I love listening to music, especially the genres of prog rock and prog metal, such as retro prog rock from Sweden (Moon Safari, A.C.T., Kaipa, Karmakanic, Brighteye Brison), and I transcribe scores in my free time (my [Musescore account](https://musescore.com/user/47656457))
- I am a competitive speedcuber (my WCA profile is [2016CHOI01](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016CHOI01)); an all-rounder but I particularly enjoy doing FTO (Face-Turning Octahedron)
